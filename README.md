# Gallery Friends Frontend

This repo contains the code for the frontend of the gallery-friends app. This app allows users to create an account, login, and post images to their page. Then, other users can see all the posts that have been added, like them, comment them, and follow other users. It's a very simple social media app I designed just for fun and to get more familiar with the NextJS framework as well as full stack app creation in general.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

All of the code that you see on each page is located in each of the page.tsx files since this app uses the NextJS app router. If changes are necessary to this frontend, edit the page.tsx pages.
